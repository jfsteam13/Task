    <h3>Introduction to DATA SCIENCE (DS)</h3>
    <p>
        Data science is the study of data to extract meaningful insights for business. It is a multidisciplinary
        approach that combines principles and practices from the fields of mathematics, statistics, artificial
        intelligence, and computer engineering to analyze large amounts of data.Data science also integrates domain
        knowledge from the underlying application domain (e.g., natural sciences, information technology, and
        medicine).[3] Data science is multifaceted and can be described as a science, a research paradigm, a research
        method, a discipline, a workflow, and a profession.[4]

        Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related methods" to
        "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data.[5] It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields
        within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, and domain knowledge.[6]
        However, data science is different from computer science and information science.<a href="signup.html">see more</a>
