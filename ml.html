    <h3>Introduction to Machine Learning ML</h3>
    <p>
        Machine Learning tutorial covers basic and advanced concepts, specially designed to cater to both students and
        experienced working professionals.

        This machine learning tutorial helps you gain a solid introduction to the fundamentals of machine learning and
        explore a wide range of techniques, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.

        Machine learning (ML) is a subdomain of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing systems that
        learn—or improve performance—based on the data they ingest. Artificial intelligence is a broad word that refers
        to systems or machines that resemble human intelligence. Machine learning and AI are frequently discussed
        together, and the terms are occasionally used interchangeably, although they do not signify the same thing. A
        crucial distinction is that, while all machine learning is AI, not all AI is machine learning <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/signup.html">see
