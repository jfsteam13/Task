    <h3>Introduction to Artificial Intelligence AI</h3>
    <p>
        Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines or software, as opposed to the intelligence of
        humans or animals. It is a field of study in computer science which develops and studies intelligent machines.
        Such machines may be called AIs.

        AI technology is widely used throughout industry, government, and science. Some high-profile applications are:
        advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and
        Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g.,
        Waymo), generative and creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games
        (such as chess and Go).[1]

        Alan Turing was the first person to carry out substantial research in the field that he called Machine
        Intelligence.[2] Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956.[3] The field went
        through multiple cycles of optimism[4][5] followed by disappointment and loss of funding..<a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/signup.html">see more</a>
